                Sodalite is responsible for boosting your confidence. It helps bolster self-esteem and opens you to accept life as it surrounds you; imperfections and all. It is known to help in letting go of fear, needless guilt, anxiety, self-criticism and similar negative self-talk. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                With it, you can get closure, reach conclusions, find your way to move on from difficult situations and emotions and grow in your life. A sodalite can also help create new patterns and improve your general outlook on your life.
