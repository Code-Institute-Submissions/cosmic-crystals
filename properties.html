            <h3>Sodalite</h3>
            <br>
            <p>
                Sodalite is responsible for boosting your confidence. It helps bolster self-esteem and opens you to accept life as it surrounds you; imperfections and all. It is known to help in letting go of fear, needless guilt, anxiety, self-criticism and similar negative self-talk. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                With it, you can get closure, reach conclusions, find your way to move on from difficult situations and emotions and grow in your life. A sodalite can also help create new patterns and improve your general outlook on your life.

                <h3>Amethyst</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In all forms, Amethyst is a powerful and protective crystal that moves energy to a higher spiritual vibration. Amethyst changes energy into love, and blocks negative energy allowing you to concentrate on the spiritual.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Psychologically, your thoughts can become less scattered and more focused; this allows you to see the true causes and effects in your life and process new ideas. 
            
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Spiritually, Amethyst crystals can take you to a higher level. When you mediate, you can develop deeper understanding. You can grow true wisdom and become aware of, or evolve, your psychic gifts.

                <h3>Selenite</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Selenite spreads peace and calm. This crystal opens channels to other worlds and carries the imprint of all that has happened. Therefore, it's valuable as an aid during meditation and spiritual work such as telepathy, accessing your between-lives state (discovering your soul in its previous lives and its' plans), and scrying.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Selenite can be placed at the centre of a room to create a peaceful and calm atmosphere; for defence against negative energies, Selenite can be placed in the internal corners of your home to form a protective grid. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Selenite can be constructured into charging bowls in order to cleanse & recharge crystal energies.

                <h3>Apophylite</h3>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Apophyllite is a very high vibrational crystal that can connect you to higher dimensions, realms and to your guardian angels and spirits. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Apophyllite is colloquially known as the reiki crystal ; it relaxes the individual by putting them into a deeper state of receptiveness. Simultaneously, Apophyllite " produces a purer transmission of energy.
