# Features

### Existing Features

-   __F01 Navigation Bar__

    - The navigation bar appears across all three pages to support the user's navigation across the content. What's more, the colour tones used in the navigation links are consistent with the colour palette across the site, which in turn, allows the navigation bar to blend in seamlessly with the other site features.

-   __F02 Landing Page & Call to Action__

    - The landing page incorporates a hero image of a collection of crystals alongside a text overlay; this is useful as it conveys a brief overview of the product portfolio to the site users. 
    - Nonetheless, the call to action of 'View our range of crystals' aligns centrally underneath the text overlay to provide the user with greater ease of navigation directly to the 'Properties' page.
